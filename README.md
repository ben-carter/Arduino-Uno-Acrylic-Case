# Arduino-Uno-Acrylic-Case
After buying a sparfun redboard kit, I designed, cut, and built a case to house both the redboard and breadboard that came with the kit. The case is tall enough to fit the wiring, lights, and other electronics that came with the sparkfun kit. The case was made from a single 48 inch by 24 inch sheet of acrylic and was cut using the laser cutting machine on Northeastern University's campus. The case is held together by a quick dry gorilla glue.
